# Project Limitations

## File Format Limitations

### .txt File Constraints
- Limited formatting preservation compared to .docx files
- No native support for embedded images, tables, or complex structures
- Equation detection relies on text patterns rather than structured markup
- Loss of document metadata and styling information

### Artifact Environment Restrictions
- Cannot process .docx files directly (browser security constraints)
- Limited to text-based file formats only
- No access to native Office document APIs
- Reduced functionality compared to local environment

### File Upload Limitations
- Browser-based file handling constraints
- Size limitations for document processing
- Limited file type validation and error handling

## Equation Processing Limitations

### OMML Equation Handling
- Complex mathematical expressions may not convert properly to LaTeX
- Nested equations and multi-line formulas pose conversion challenges
- Some specialized mathematical symbols may be lost or misrepresented
- Equation numbering and referencing may not be preserved accurately

### Equation Detection and Placement
- Difficulty distinguishing between inline and block equations
- May miss mathematical expressions written in plain text format
- Equation context and surrounding text relationship may be lost
- Limited support for equation arrays and aligned expressions

### LaTeX Conversion Issues
- Not all equation formats supported for LaTeX output
- Potential formatting inconsistencies in converted equations
- Custom equation macros and definitions may not be preserved

## Table Processing Limitations

### Structure Recognition
- Complex table structures with merged cells not fully supported
- Nested tables within cells may cause parsing errors
- Table spanning across multiple pages may be fragmented

### Caption and Formatting
- Table captions may not be properly identified or positioned
- Cell formatting, borders, and styling information often lost
- Column width and alignment preferences not preserved
- Header row identification may be inconsistent

## Template-Specific Limitations

### IEEE Template Constraints
- Strict formatting requirements may conflict with parsed content
- Limited customization options for bibliography styles
- Specific section ordering requirements may not match source document

### ACM Template Restrictions
- Author affiliation formatting constraints
- Limited flexibility in abstract and keyword placement
- Specific citation format requirements

### Springer Template Issues
- Complex author metadata requirements
- Strict figure and table placement rules
- Limited support for custom environments

## Processing and Performance Constraints

### Memory and Performance
- Large documents may cause browser memory issues
- Processing time increases significantly with document size
- Concurrent processing of multiple documents not supported

### Content Length Limitations
- Very long documents may timeout during processing
- Complex documents with many elements may fail to parse completely
- Browser-based processing has inherent memory constraints

### Parse Error Recovery
- Limited error handling for malformed documents
- Incomplete recovery mechanisms when parsing fails
- May lose content when encountering unsupported elements

## Implementation and Code Limitations

### Error Handling
- Incomplete error recovery mechanisms throughout the codebase
- Inconsistent error reporting across different modules
- Limited user feedback when processing fails

### Content Processing Issues
- Content compression may result in information loss
- Abbreviation and acronym handling not comprehensive
- Special character escaping may cause formatting issues
- Unicode character support limitations

### Dependency Limitations
- mammoth.js library constraints for .docx processing
- JSZip limitations for handling complex document structures
- Browser API limitations for file system access

## User Interface and Functionality Limitations

### Export and Download Restrictions
- Limited export format options
- Browser download limitations and restrictions
- No support for batch processing or automated workflows

### User Experience Constraints
- Limited preview capabilities before final export
- No real-time processing feedback or progress indicators
- Limited customization options for output formatting

### Integration Limitations
- No direct Overleaf integration or API connectivity
- Limited support for external template repositories
- No collaborative editing or sharing capabilities

## Environment and Deployment Limitations

### Browser Compatibility
- Specific browser requirements for optimal functionality
- Limited support for older browser versions
- Cross-browser consistency issues with certain features

### Security Constraints
- Browser security policies limit file system access
- No server-side processing capabilities in current implementation
- Limited ability to handle sensitive or proprietary document formats

## Content Handling Limitations

### Text Processing
- May not preserve all text formatting nuances
- Limited support for custom fonts and typography
- Special characters and symbols may be converted incorrectly

### Image and Media Handling
- Limited image processing and conversion capabilities
- No support for embedded media files or complex graphics
- Image resolution and quality may be reduced during processing

### Citation and Bibliography
- Limited support for various citation formats
- May not preserve all bibliographic metadata
- Cross-reference handling between citations and references incomplete

## Future Enhancement Areas

### Known Issues Requiring Resolution
- Improve equation detection accuracy and LaTeX conversion
- Enhance table structure recognition and formatting preservation
- Develop better error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Expand file format support beyond current limitations
- Implement more robust content compression without information loss
- Add support for collaborative features and direct Overleaf integration

### Performance Optimization Needs
- Optimize processing for large documents
- Implement progressive loading and processing
- Add support for background processing and queue management
- Develop caching mechanisms for improved performance
