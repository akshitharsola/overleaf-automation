# DOCX Analyzer - Working Backup (12/07/2025)

## Files Saved
- **ENHANCED_DOCX_ANALYZER_12072025.tsx** - Full working React component with OMML extraction
- **DocxAnalyzer.css** - Complete styling for the analyzer
- **package.json** - Project dependencies and configuration

## Key Breakthrough
Successfully implemented OMML (Office Math Markup Language) extraction from DOCX files using:
- JSZip for direct XML parsing
- Proper XML namespace handling
- OMML to LaTeX conversion

## Technical Solution
The critical fix was parsing the raw DOCX XML structure instead of relying on mammoth.js text conversion. This allowed extraction of actual mathematical equations rather than surrounding text descriptions.

## Dependencies
- react ^19.1.0
- jszip ^3.10.1  
- lucide-react ^0.525.0
- mammoth.js (loaded via CDN)

## Usage
This backup preserves the working solution that correctly detects and extracts mathematical equations from Word documents. The component can be integrated into any React application or used as a standalone analyzer.

## Notes
