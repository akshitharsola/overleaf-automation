# Attempt-3 - Final Implementation Summary

## üéØ **Quick Overview**
This folder contains the final implementation that successfully resolves the critical equation placement and table filtering issues.

## üìÅ **Key Files**
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY_ATTEMPT3.md` - **READ THIS FIRST** - Comprehensive documentation
- `DocumentParser.ts` - Enhanced equation detection with 5-tier matching system
- `LatexGenerator.ts` - Superior table formatting integration
- `DocumentTypes.ts` - Type definitions for unified processing
- `package.json` - Project dependencies

## ‚úÖ **Major Accomplishments**

### **Equation Placement - RESOLVED** 
- **Context-based placement**: Detects "Below is my equation" indicators
- **5 matching strategies**: From exact content to context-based indicators
- **Proper LaTeX formatting**: Inline and display equation support

### **Table Processing - ENHANCED**
- **Smart filtering**: Removes headings, preserves references (80% similarity threshold)
- **Superior formatting**: Integrated proven `Latex_working_table_09072025.tsx` mechanism
- **Reference preservation**: Keeps "Table 1" references while removing "Table 1: Heading"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Key Limitation**
**Equation placement depends on context indicators** like:
- "Below is my equation"
- "Here is the mathematical expression"
- "The equation follows"

Documents should include such indicators for optimal equation placement.

## üöÄ **Status**
‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY** - Both critical issues resolved
